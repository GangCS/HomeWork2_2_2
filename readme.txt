You can see the assignment at the following link: https://github.com/gamedev-at-ariel/gamedev-5781/blob/master/02-unity-basics/homework.pdf
The aim of the project was to get to know the unity environment and practice the language C #.
Second section:
1.	We had to build a game where the player can move in a two-dimensional world with the arrow keys, and at the same time he sees his location on a small map (mini-map) on the top right. You can see a demo on the website: https://shaharnik.itch.io/homework2-2-2
